> I'm Peace. I'm applying for the role of Front End developer.



I work on frontend development which is building out the visual components of a website or webapp. I work with frontend technologies like HTML CSS JavaScript and it's frameworks.



I have quality experience working with HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Javascript and API's. I do have little experience with ReactJS and I have done some demo projects on my github.

\
I believe I'm the best candidate for this opportunity as I possess the required skills for the job and I can apply my existing skills and also learn new ones. I also believe my soft skills like good communication, critical thinking, attention to details, teamwork and problem solving will help me achieve success in this job.\
\
I expect that this job will expose me to a new working culture, a new environment and also boost my professional growth.



Outside of coding, I enjoy baking a whole lot. I started out as a baker right after high school before I transitioned to tech.



Here's more on my development;

Github - [https://github.com/​onyeepeace](https://github.com/onyeepeace)

Portfolio - [https://onyeepeace.com](https://onyeepeace.com/)

LinkedIn - [https://linkedin.com/in/​onyeepeace](https://linkedin.com/in/onyeepeace)

I have attached my resume as well.



I look forward to hearing from you.



Best Regards,

Peace.
